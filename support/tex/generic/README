This is an experimental system for generating the preamble formats.

You can generate a format file dump_preamble.fmt by changing to this
directory and running the command:

	etex -ini \&latex dump_preamble.tex \\dump

Then running tex with the dump_preamble format will dump a custom
format corresponding to the preamble.

This is not currently used by Latex Watch, because I can't find a
good solution to the problem of extracting the NON-preamble parts
of the document in complicated cases (e.g. where \begin{document}
is not in the main file, but in an \include'd one).
